# The `PyFace' Computer Vision Project: Implementation and Analysis of Emotional Recognition using Facial Expressions and Machine Learning

This is a repo to keep track of the progress of my dissertation project. Any tips on the issues I raise would be greatly appreciated, but much in the way of StackOverflow I would prefer help/guidance/suggested code rather than anybody rewriting my code, as obviously this has to be my work!

svms.py, cnn.py, sc.py, extraction_model.py contain the important parts.
