"""Python script to sort the Cohn-Kanade+ AU-Coded Expression Database.

I have taken the CK+ dataset and split it into 'Emotion' and
'Images' folders within 'CK_Dataset' positioned in my working directory.
Permission via link: http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/

As taken from : http://www.pitt.edu/~emotion/ck-spread.htm
    'The Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded Facial Expression Database is for research in
    automatic facial image analysis and synthesis and for perceptual studies.
    Cohn-Kanade is available in two versions and a third is in preparation.'

I am using the first version. Version 1, the initial release,
includes 486 sequences from 97 posers. Each sequence begins with a neutral
expression and proceeds to a peak expression. The peak expression for each
sequence in fully FACS (Ekman, Friesen, & Hager, 2002; Ekman & Friesen, 1979)
coded and given an emotion label. The emotion label refers to what expression
was requested rather than what may actually have been performed.
For a full description of CK, see (Kanade, Cohn, & Tian, 2000).
For a description of the extension to CK called CK+, see the website.

I use this dataset with full permission granted. Pictures Â©Jeffrey Cohn.

Next I convert all pictures to the same extension (PNG), matrix and grayscale,
and copied them to their respective folder into 'combined_dataset' for further
processing.
